<h2><u>Amazon CodeWhisperer Preview Terms</u></h2>
<p>
    The Amazon CodeWhisperer service is provided as a 'Beta Service' and an 'AI Service' as defined in the AWS
    Service Terms. Usage of the CodeWhisperer Beta Service is governed by your Agreement with AWS and the
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/">AWS Service Terms</a>, as supplemented by these additional terms,
    which are made part of Section 2 ('Betas and Previews') of the Service Terms. Any term undefined in these
    CodeWhisperer preview terms will have the meaning assigned to it in the Agreement and Service Terms.
</p>
<p>
    Before using the CodeWhisperer Beta Service, please review the Betas and Previews terms found
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/">here</a>. The CodeWhisperer Beta Service uses certain information
    to provide and/or improve the service, including:
</p>
<p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
    <tr >
        <td><b>Data type</b></td>
        <td><b>Examples</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Contextual information</td>
        <td>file content, filename, programming language, cursor location, active line number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Feedback</td>
        <td>acceptance or rejection of recommendations, modifications to recommendations, user settings</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Telemetry metrics</td>
        <td>latency, errors, CodeWhisperer API interactions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>User environment information</td>
        <td>which IDE is being used, OS information, transfer protocols</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
    The CodeWhisperer preview period will help us conduct key testing and research in order to improve CodeWhisperer
    and prepare it for general availability. For Your Content processed by the CodeWhisperer Beta Service (the
    "CodeWhisperer Content"), you agree and instruct that (a) we may use and store the CodeWhisperer Content to
    maintain and provide the CodeWhisperer services (including development and improvement of the CodeWhisperer
    services and underlying technology); (b) we may use and store the CodeWhisperer Content that is not personal data
    to develop and improve AWS and affiliate machine-learning and artificial-intelligence technologies; and (c) solely
    in connection with the development and improvement described in clauses (a) and (b), we may store the Content in
    an AWS region outside of the AWS region where you are using CodeWhisperer. If you have participated in the
    CodeWhisperer preview and would like Your Content deleted, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:codewhisperer@amazon.com">codewhisperer@amazon.com</a>. As part of the CodeWhisperer preview,
    we may offer you the option to toggle CodeWhisperer Content sharing on or off through the Beta Service. If you
    decline to share CodeWhisperer Content through the Beta Service for an account or set of credentials, we will
    refrain from collecting the applicable CodeWhisperer Content for this purpose and will delete any of that
    CodeWhisperer Content that we have collected for this purpose. In addition, we may offer you the option through
    the Beta Service to limit the collection of metadata, feedback, or other usage metrics which are not CodeWhisperer
    Content for service improvement (for example, whether a recommendation was accepted or rejected, but not the
    content of that recommendation).
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding any other term to the contrary in any agreement between you (or your affiliates) and AWS, and
    without limitation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        you acknowledge that CodeWhisperer output is a computational result based on the input you provide to the
        Beta Service, and that multiple users may receive the same or similar output. For clarity, although these
        computational results are Your Content, the same or similar outputs are independently created, and AWS will
        not be restricted from providing the same or similar output to other customers.
    </li>
    <li>
        if you would like to instruct AWS to refrain from using collected CodeWhisperer Content for service
        improvement, you must either: (a) submit a request at the deletion link identified in these beta terms and
        refrain from further usage of the CodeWhisperer Beta Service; or (b) if available, leverage the applicable
        data sharing toggle option(s) within the CodeWhisperer Beta Service.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Beta Service is subject to change and cancellation. <b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE CODEWHISPERER BETA SERVICE.</b>
